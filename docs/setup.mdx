## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">
Get the source code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground.git
cd animation-playground
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using Yarn (recommended)
yarn install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

<Success>
We recommend using Yarn as it's what the project was developed with, but npm and pnpm work just as well.
</Success>
</Step>

<Step title="Environment Configuration">
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration (required for user accounts and saving)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional: Advanced Supabase configuration
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_supabase_jwt_secret
```

</Step>

<Step title="Get Supabase Credentials (Optional)">
<Card title="Supabase Setup" icon="database">
For user accounts and saving functionality:
