# Quick Start Guide

Get Animation Playground running on your local machine in just a few steps. This guide will walk you through everything from prerequisites to your first animation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

> ⚠️ **Warning:** > **Required Software** - Node.js (version 18.x or higher recommended) - Yarn,
> npm, or pnpm package manager - Git for version control

### Optional Prerequisites

- **Supabase Account**: Required only if you want to use backend features like saving configurations
- **Code Editor**: VS Code recommended for the best development experience

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground.git
cd animation-playground
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using Yarn (recommended)
yarn install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

> ℹ️ **Info:**
> We recommend using Yarn as it's what the project was developed with, but npm
> and pnpm work just as well.

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration (required for user accounts and saving)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional: Advanced Supabase configuration
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_supabase_jwt_secret
```

2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key
5. Paste them into your `.env.local` file

</details>

### 4. Database Setup (Optional)

If you're planning to use the save/load functionality, set up the database:

```bash
# Generate migration files (if schema changes were made)
yarn drizzle-kit generate

# Apply migrations to your database
yarn drizzle-kit migrate
```

> 📝 **Note:**
> The app will work without database setup, but you won't be able to save or
> share animations.

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the Animation Playground!

## Verification

Once the server is running, you should see:

1. **Homepage**: The main landing page with navigation
2. **Playground**: The animation creation interface
3. **Live Preview**: Real-time animation preview as you make changes

### Test the Installation

1. Navigate to the playground page
2. Try creating a simple fade animation
3. Adjust the duration and see the live preview update
4. Test the code generation feature

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 3000 already in use**

```bash
# Use a different port
yarn dev -p 3001
```

**Module not found errors**

```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
yarn install
```

**Supabase connection issues**

- Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct credentials
- Check that your Supabase project is active
- Ensure the database URL is accessible
