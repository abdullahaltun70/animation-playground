# Sharing & Exporting

Once you've created the perfect animation, Animation Playground makes it easy to share your work with others and export code for use in your own projects.

## Sharing Animations

### Public Sharing

Every animation configuration can be shared with a unique URL that allows others to:

- **View the Animation**: See your creation in action
- **Inspect Settings**: Examine the configuration parameters
- **Copy and Modify**: Create their own version based on your work
- **Export Code**: Generate code from your shared animation

### How to Share

1. **Create Your Animation**: Use the playground to design your animation
2. **Save Configuration**: Give your animation a descriptive name and save it
3. **Generate Share Link**: Click the "Share" button in the preview panel
4. **Copy URL**: The unique URL is automatically copied to your clipboard
5. **Share Away**: Send the link via email, social media, or embed it in documentation

> ℹ️ **Info:**
> Shared animations are public and read-only. Viewers can see and copy your work
> but cannot modify the original configuration.

### Share Link Features

**Read-Only Access**

- Viewers see your animation exactly as you configured it
- Configuration panel shows all settings but in read-only mode
- Preview works exactly the same as in edit mode

**Copy Protection**

- Original creator retains ownership
- Viewers can make copies but cannot overwrite the original
- Attribution is maintained through the share system

**No Account Required**

- Anyone with the link can view the animation
- Viewers don't need to create an account to see your work
- Perfect for sharing with clients or team members

## Exporting Code

Animation Playground generates clean, production-ready code that you can use directly in your projects.

### Export Formats

#### React Component

Export your animation as a ready-to-use React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Animate } from 'animation-library-test-abdullah-altun';

const MyFadeAnimation = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <Animate type="fade" duration={0.5} easing="ease-out" {...props}>
      {children}
    </Animate>
  );
};

export default MyFadeAnimation;
```

**Benefits:**

- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Reusable across your application
- Follows React best practices
- Includes all configuration options as props

#### CSS Classes

For non-React projects or when you prefer CSS-based animations:

```css
.fade-in-animation {
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Framework-agnostic
- Lightweight and performant
- Easy to customize further
- Works with any HTML element

#### Animation Config

Export the raw configuration object for advanced use cases:

```json
{
  "type": "fade",
  "duration": 0.5,
  "easing": "ease-out",
  "delay": 0,
  "direction": "normal",
  "iterations": 1,
  "fillMode": "both"
}
```

**Use Cases:**

- Storing configurations in databases
- Dynamically creating animations
- Integration with other animation libraries
- Documentation and specifications

### How to Export

1. **Complete Your Animation**: Finish configuring your animation
2. **Open Export Dialog**: Click the "Export" button in the preview panel
3. **Choose Format**: Select React Component, CSS, or Config JSON
4. **Copy Code**: Click the copy button to copy to clipboard
5. **Use in Project**: Paste the code into your project files

> 💡 **Tip:**
> The React component export includes TypeScript types and is ready to use with
> modern React applications!

## Integration Guide

### Using React Components

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the animation library installed

   ```bash
   npm install animation-library-test-abdullah-altun
   ```

2. **Import and Use**: Use the exported component in your React app

   ```jsx
   import MyAnimation from './components/MyAnimation';

   function App() {
     return (
       <MyAnimation>
         <div>This content will be animated</div>
       </MyAnimation>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Customize**: Pass additional props to modify behavior
   ```jsx
   <MyAnimation duration={1.0} delay={0.5}>
     <div>Slower animation with delay</div>
   </MyAnimation>
   ```

### Using CSS Classes

1. **Add Styles**: Include the exported CSS in your stylesheet
2. **Apply Classes**: Add the class to your HTML elements

   ```html
   <div class="fade-in-animation">This content will animate</div>
   ```

3. **Trigger Animations**: Use JavaScript to add/remove classes as needed
   ```javascript
   // Trigger animation
   element.classList.add('fade-in-animation');
   ```

### Advanced Integration

#### Conditional Animations

```jsx
const ConditionalAnimation = ({ shouldAnimate, children }) => {
  return shouldAnimate ? <MyAnimation>{children}</MyAnimation> : children;
};
```

#### Animation Sequences

```jsx
const SequencedAnimations = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <MyAnimation delay={0}>First element</MyAnimation>
      <MyAnimation delay={0.2}>Second element</MyAnimation>
      <MyAnimation delay={0.4}>Third element</MyAnimation>
    </>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices

### Sharing Guidelines

**Naming Conventions**

- Use descriptive names for your animations
- Include the animation type in the name
- Consider the use case (e.g., "Button Hover Scale", "Page Enter Slide")

**Documentation**

- Add comments explaining when to use the animation
- Include performance considerations
- Note any dependencies or requirements

**Version Control**

- Keep track of different versions of your animations
- Use semantic versioning for significant changes
- Maintain backwards compatibility when possible

### Export Optimization

**Code Quality**

- Review exported code before using in production
- Test animations in your target environment
- Consider accessibility implications

**Performance**

- Monitor animation performance in your application
- Use browser dev tools to profile animations
- Consider reduced motion preferences

**Maintenance**

- Keep animation library dependencies up to date
- Test animations after library updates
- Document any customizations you make

## Collaboration Features

### Team Workflows

**Designer to Developer**

1. Designer creates animation in playground
2. Designer shares link with developer
3. Developer exports appropriate code format
4. Developer integrates into application

**Code Reviews**

- Include animation links in pull requests
- Review animations alongside code changes
- Test animations in different environments

**Documentation**

- Embed animation links in style guides
- Create animation pattern libraries
- Maintain examples for common use cases

> ✅ **Success:** > **Pro Tip**: Create a shared collection of team animations by maintaining a
> document with links to commonly used animation configurations!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Export Issues

**Missing Dependencies**

- Ensure animation library is installed
- Check version compatibility
- Verify import paths are correct

**Styling Conflicts**

- Check for CSS conflicts with existing styles
- Use CSS specificity to override conflicting rules
- Test in isolated environment first

**Performance Issues**

- Profile animations in browser dev tools
- Consider reducing complexity for mobile devices
- Use `transform` properties instead of layout properties

### Share Link Problems

**Link Not Working**

- Verify the animation was saved before sharing
- Check that the share URL is complete
- Ensure the server is accessible

**Viewer Experience Issues**

- Test share links in incognito/private browsing
- Verify animations work without user accounts
- Check on different devices and browsers
