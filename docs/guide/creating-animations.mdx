# Creating Animations

<Info>
  Animation Playground makes it easy to create beautiful web animations through
  an intuitive interface. This guide will walk you through the process step by
  step.
</Info>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Playground">
Navigate to the main application at `http://localhost:3000` and click on the **"Playground"** link in the navigation
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Interface">
You'll see the animation creation interface with two main panels:

<Card title="Configuration Panel" icon="sliders">
**Left Side**

Where you set up your animation properties, timing, and effects

</Card>
<Card title="Preview Panel" icon="eye">
**Right Side**

Where you see your animation in action with real-time updates

</Card>
</CardGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Animation Types

<Warning>
  Understanding the different animation types will help you choose the right
  effect for your use case.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Fade" icon="eye">
**Opacity Effects**

- **In**: Element appears by fading from transparent to opaque
- **Out**: Element disappears by fading from opaque to transparent
- **InOut**: Combines fade in and fade out

</Card>
<Card title="Slide" icon="arrows-alt">
**Movement Effects**

- **Up/Down**: Element moves vertically
- **Left/Right**: Element moves horizontally
- **Diagonal**: Element moves in diagonal directions

</Card>
<Card title="Scale" icon="expand">
**Size Effects**

- **Up**: Element grows from small to normal size
- **Down**: Element shrinks from normal to small size
- **Bounce**: Element scales with a bouncing effect
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Rotate" icon="sync">
**Rotation Effects**

- **Clockwise**: Element rotates clockwise
- **Counter-clockwise**: Element rotates counter-clockwise
- **Full rotation**: 360-degree rotation

</Card>
<Card title="Bounce" icon="arrow-up">
**Spring Effects**

- **Up/Down**: Element bounces vertically
- **Left/Right**: Element bounces horizontally
- **Elastic**: Spring-like bouncing effects
</Card>
</CardGroup>
- **Left/Right**: Element bounces horizontally
- **Spring**: Spring-like bouncing effect

> 💡 **Tip:**
> Each animation type has its own set of configurable properties. Experiment
> with different combinations to create unique effects!

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings

**Animation Type**

- Select from the dropdown menu
- Each type reveals specific configuration options

**Duration**

- Control how long the animation takes to complete
- Range: 0.1s to 5.0s
- Use shorter durations for snappy effects, longer for smooth transitions

**Delay**

- Set when the animation should start after being triggered
- Useful for creating sequences of animations

### Advanced Settings

**Easing Function**

- **Linear**: Constant speed throughout
- **Ease**: Slow start, fast middle, slow end
- **Ease-in**: Slow start, speeds up
- **Ease-out**: Fast start, slows down
- **Ease-in-out**: Slow start and end, fast middle
- **Custom**: Define your own cubic-bezier curve

**Iteration Count**

- **Once**: Animation plays once
- **Infinite**: Animation loops continuously
- **Custom**: Specify exact number of repetitions

**Direction**

- **Normal**: Animation plays forward
- **Reverse**: Animation plays backward
- **Alternate**: Animation alternates between forward and reverse

## Creating Your First Animation

Let's create a simple fade-in animation:

### Step 1: Choose Animation Type

1. In the Configuration Panel, click the "Animation Type" dropdown
2. Select **"Fade In"**

### Step 2: Set Duration

1. Use the duration slider or input field
2. Set it to **0.5 seconds** for a quick fade

### Step 3: Preview

- The preview panel will automatically show your animation
- Click the play button to replay it
- You'll see the element fade in smoothly

### Step 4: Fine-tune

1. Adjust the easing to **"ease-out"** for a more natural feel
2. Add a **0.2s delay** if you want the animation to start later
3. Watch the preview update in real-time

> ✅ **Success:** > **Congratulations!** You've created your first animation. The preview shows
> exactly how it will look in your application.

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Animations

While the playground focuses on individual animations, you can create complex effects by:

1. **Sequencing**: Use delays to chain animations
2. **Layering**: Apply different animations to nested elements
3. **Timing**: Synchronize multiple animations with matching durations

### Responsive Animations

Consider how your animations will look on different screen sizes:

- **Mobile**: Shorter durations and distances work better
- **Desktop**: More elaborate animations are acceptable
- **Reduced Motion**: Always respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Performance Considerations

- **Transform vs Position**: Use transform properties for better performance
- **Duration**: Very long animations (>2s) can feel sluggish
- **Frequency**: Don't animate too many elements simultaneously

## Testing Your Animation

### Preview Controls

- **Play Button**: Restart the animation from the beginning
- **Pause Button**: Stop the animation at its current state
- **Reset Button**: Return to the initial state

### Different States

Test your animation in various scenarios:

- **Initial Load**: How does it look when the page first loads?
- **User Interaction**: If triggered by user actions, test those interactions
- **Repeat Views**: How does it behave when triggered multiple times?

## Saving Your Work

Once you're happy with your animation:

1. **Name Your Animation**: Give it a descriptive name
2. **Save Configuration**: Click the save button (requires account)
3. **Generate Code**: Export as React component or CSS

> ℹ️ **Info:**
> Saved animations are stored in your personal library and can be accessed from
> any device when you're logged in.

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Sharing & Exporting](https://docs.page/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground/guide/sharing-exporting) your animations
- Explore [User Accounts](https://docs.page/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground/guide/user-accounts) to save and manage your work
- Check out the [Available Scripts](https://docs.page/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground/available-scripts) for development workflows

## Common Patterns

### Loading Animations

- Use fade-in with scale up for elements appearing
- Duration: 0.3-0.5s works well
- Easing: ease-out feels natural

### Hover Effects

- Subtle scale (1.05x) or slight movement
- Duration: 0.2s for responsiveness
- Use transform properties for performance

### Page Transitions

- Slide animations work well for navigation
- Consider the direction of user flow
- Duration: 0.4-0.6s for page-level changes
