- Update existing tests when modifying code
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Maintain or improve test coverage

**Running Quality Checks**

```bash
# Run all quality checks
yarn checks

yarn prettier     # Code formatting
yarn test         # Test suite
```

### Commit Guidelines

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(animations): add rotation presets"

```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

**Type Safety**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Explicit types
interface AnimationConfig {
  type: 'fade' | 'slide' | 'scale';
  duration: number;
  easing?: string;
}

// ❌ Avoid: Any types
const config: any = { ... };
```

**Naming Conventions**

- `PascalCase`: Components, interfaces, types
- `camelCase`: Variables, functions, methods
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`: Constants
- `kebab-case`: File names (except components)

### React Patterns

**Component Structure**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Clear component structure
interface Props {
  animation: AnimationConfig;
  onPlay: () => void;
}

export const AnimationPreview: React.FC<Props> = ({
  animation,
  onPlay
}) => {
  // Hooks first
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);

  // Event handlers
  const handlePlay = useCallback(() => {
    setIsPlaying(true);
    onPlay();
  }, [onPlay]);

  // Render
  return (
    <div className="animation-preview">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Custom Hooks**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Reusable logic in hooks
export const useAnimationConfig = () => {
  const [config, setConfig] = useState<AnimationConfig>();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const saveConfig = useCallback(async (newConfig: AnimationConfig) => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      await api.saveAnimation(newConfig);
      setConfig(newConfig);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  return { config, loading, saveConfig };
};
```

### Styling Guidelines

**SCSS Modules**

```scss
// AnimationPreview.module.scss
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;

  &.isPlaying {
    border-color: var(--color-primary);
  }
}

.playButton {
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;

  &:hover {
    background-color: var(--color-primary-hover);
  }
}
```

**Responsive Design**

```scss
.container {
  // Mobile first
  padding: 1rem;

  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    padding: 2rem;
  }

  @media (min-width: 1024px) {
    padding: 3rem;
  }
}
```
