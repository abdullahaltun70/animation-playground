# E2E Workflow Simplification: Removing .next Artifact

## Problem Solved
The workflow was failing due to complexity around uploading and downloading the `.next` build folder as an artifact between jobs. This approach had several issues:

1. **Artifact upload/download complexity** - GitHub Actions artifact handling can be tricky with folder structures
2. **Gitignore conflicts** - The `.next` folder is in `.gitignore` but created during CI
3. **Build dependencies** - Jobs had to wait for artifact upload/download
4. **Failure points** - More steps = more potential points of failure

## Solution: Build in Each Job
Instead of trying to share the build artifact, each job now builds independently:

### Before (Complex Artifact Approach)
```yaml
# Install job
- build: yarn build
- upload .next folder as artifact

# Test jobs  
- download .next artifact
- install dependencies separately
- start: yarn start (using pre-built .next)
```

### After (Simple Independent Builds)
```yaml
# Cache job
- cache Cypress binary only

# Test jobs
- build: yarn build (fresh build per job)
- start: yarn start (using newly built .next)
```

## Benefits
✅ **Eliminates artifact failures** - No more "No files were found with the provided path: .next"  
✅ **Simpler workflow** - Fewer steps, less complexity  
✅ **Faster execution** - No artifact upload/download time  
✅ **More reliable** - Each job is self-contained  
✅ **Fresh builds** - Each test runs against a clean, current build  
✅ **Better parallelization** - Jobs are truly independent  

## Performance Impact
- **Slight increase in build time** - Each job builds independently (~1-2 minutes per job)
- **Major decrease in complexity** - Eliminates artifact handling overhead
- **Better reliability** - Self-contained jobs are more predictable

For Next.js applications, the build time is typically fast enough that this approach is preferable to complex artifact management.

## Jobs Updated
- `cache-cypress` - Only caches Cypress binary (renamed from `install`)
- `cypress-chrome` - Builds independently (4 parallel workers)
- `cypress-firefox` - Builds independently (2 parallel workers)  
- `cypress-edge` - Builds independently (1 worker)
- `cypress-accessibility` - Builds independently (1 worker)
- `cypress-mobile` - Builds independently (1 worker)

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`

## Result
The e2e-tests workflow is now simpler, more reliable, and free from artifact-related failures while maintaining full parallel testing capabilities across 9 workers.
