# Documentation Guide

## ✅ Correct Way to Access docs.page

Your Animation Playground documentation is properly set up and accessible at:

**🔗 [docs.page/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground](https://docs.page/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground)**

## How docs.page Works

docs.page automatically serves documentation from GitHub repositories by:
1. Reading your `docs.json` configuration file
2. Parsing MDX files in your `/docs` folder  
3. Serving them through their platform with automatic navigation and styling

## Repository Requirements ✅

Your repository meets all requirements:
- ✅ Public GitHub repository 
- ✅ `docs.json` configuration file in root
- ✅ Documentation files in `/docs` folder
- ✅ Proper MDX format with frontmatter
- ✅ All files committed to GitHub

## Making Documentation Changes

To update your documentation:

1. **Edit files locally** in the `/docs` folder
2. **Commit and push changes** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update documentation"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Wait a few minutes** for docs.page to sync with GitHub
4. **Visit the docs.page URL** to see your changes

## Troubleshooting

### If docs.page shows an error:
- Ensure your repository is public on GitHub
- Check that `docs.json` is valid JSON (no syntax errors)
- Verify all referenced files in `docs.json` exist in the `/docs` folder
- Make sure changes are committed and pushed to GitHub

### If you see 405 Method Not Allowed:
- ❌ Don't try to "preview" locally via POST requests
- ✅ Always access through the public URL: `https://docs.page/abdullahaltun70/animation-playground`

### Alternative Documentation Access:
- **Local TypeDoc**: Run `yarn typedoc` for API documentation
- **Raw files**: Browse the `/docs` folder directly on GitHub
- **Development**: API docs available at `/docs` when running `yarn dev`
